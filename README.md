# Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator

## Task

For this project, I was given the task of creating a command-line application that dynamically
generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

## Submission

- Github Repo URL: https://github.com/r-r-i/README-generator

Note that the Deployed URL below is not currently live. As of now, this application is purely created and intended to be used on the
command line. Upcoming patches introduce a front-end application.

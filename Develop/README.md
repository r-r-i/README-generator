## about this project

For this project, I was given the task of creating a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

## installation instructions

To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm i
```

## usage information

This application is purely made on the back end, and does not have any front-end visual tied to it. You must install Node.js before attemping to run the application. Ensure you install the Inquirer Package v^6.5.2, as this application will not run with an older version.

## contribution guidelines

Contributions are not accepted. This is a private project.

## test instructions

```
npm run test
```
